# Local PC session ↔ cloud session: coordination

The user runs **two Claude sessions on this branch at the same time**: the cloud session and a local PC session (with GPU, Blender GUI access and the Meshy MCP). This file keeps them from stepping on each other. **Read it after every pull.**

## Split of work (from 2026-09-27)
| Area | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Game code, world layout, placing assets in scenes, lighting and grading | **cloud** | Keep doing what you're doing |
| New 3D assets (Meshy, Blender, open-source sourcing), optimization, previews | **local** | Only adds new files under `kingdom/assets/incoming/`, `kingdom/assets/generated/`, `tools/`, `docs/asset_gallery/` |
| Interiors (inn, blacksmith, guild, healer, houses) | **local** builds the room scenes in `kingdom/scenes/interiors/` (new files) | **cloud** wires the door triggers into the world (the local side will leave a small, self-contained `interior_door.gd` you can drop in) |

Rules:
- The local session **doesn't edit** existing game scripts or scenes unless this file says otherwise. If the local side needs a hook, it writes the request here instead.
- Both sides: `git fetch`, then merge before pushing (the cloud session pushes often).

## Ready for the cloud to integrate
Everything below is optimized for mobile, licence-checked (CC0/MIT, or CC-BY with credit), and has previews in `docs/asset_gallery/index.html`.

- `incoming/ai3d/meshy/`: 5 house types (`house_peasant_a/b`, `house_family`, `house_trader`, `house_manor`) and 2 market stalls, each with `_lod0`/`_lod1`. **These replace the Blender village houses.** Use the same near/far LOD swap as the hero buildings.
- `incoming/ai3d/meshy/creatures/`: goblin, orc, troll, wolf, boar, bear, spider and wyvern (rigged; clips idle/walk/run/attack/hit/death; `_lod1` files). Meshy bipeds have empty hands, so attach weapons to `RightHand`.
- `generated/props/`: 21 upgraded village props sharing `props_atlas.png` (replaces the old lamp post, notice board, signpost and fence).
- `incoming/characters/`: more NPCs on the UAL skeleton (G6, CDmir) plus 166 extra UAL clips. See the "Recommendation" section of its README for the `Assets.UAL_FILES` lines.
- `incoming/animals/`: 26 CC0 animals.
- `incoming/armor/`: armor library. Most plate pieces are off-style; armored characters are coming from Meshy instead (below).
- **Landmarks** in `incoming/ai3d/meshy/`: `landmark_runestone` (8k/2.5k tris; replaces the Blender runestone across the runestone network; its glowing channels suit an emissive pulse tied to stone power/condition), `landmark_rift` (the Rift entrance, 20k/6k), `landmark_watchfort` (frontier outpost with tower and palisade, 40k/12k). Each has `_lod0`/`_lod1`.
- **Interiors ready.** `scenes/interiors/{inn,blacksmith,guild,healer,house}_interior.tscn` (the house one is shared by all 5 house types). Each has 23k–58k tris, 4 materials, vertex-baked lighting, at most 2 unshadowed OmniLights, box colliders, `PlayerSpawn`, an `ExitDoor`, and `NPC_*` markers. To wire them, drop an `Area3D` with `scripts/interiors/interior_door.gd` on each building door and set `interior_scene`. Exact code, the building→scene table and how it works: `kingdom/scenes/interiors/README.md`. Previews: `docs/kingdom/blender_previews/_interiors_sheet.png`. Rebuild with `tools/blender/make_interior_*.py`.

## In progress on the local side
- Done: armored characters (`incoming/ai3d/meshy/armored/`; the cloud has already wired them) and interiors (above). **Cloud: please wire the door triggers** with `interior_door.gd` on the inn, blacksmith, guild, healer and the 5 house types (see `kingdom/scenes/interiors/README.md`), and call `InteriorDoor.active.leave()` on player death.
- Next on the local side: real-GPU performance pass (fps and frame times in village, capital and battle on this PC's RTX 4070, then Android export), with results written here.

## Merge etiquette (learned 2026-09-27)
A local Godot import creates `.import` files and extracted textures that the cloud side also commits. If a merge aborts with "untracked working tree files would be overwritten", delete only the listed `.import`/`.jpg` files (they're regenerated) and merge again.

## Requests for the cloud session
- **From `docs/OPEN_SOURCE_AUDIT.md` (store-release blockers, game-code side):**
  1. Add an in-game **Licences/Credits screen** that shows `kingdom/CREDITS.md`. The MIT notices for Godot and the addons, and the CC-BY credits, must ship with the app.
  2. Add an **export preset** that excludes `assets/incoming/**` packs the game doesn't load (about 528 MB imported but unused) and the Poly Haven model sources. Otherwise the store build bloats by about 700 MB.
  3. **LimboAI and Terrain3D** point at iOS binaries that aren't in the repo. Disable those plugins until they're used, or the iOS export fails.
  4. Wire in the 166 extra CC0 UAL clips already in `incoming/characters/_library` (dodges, deaths, bow, climb, two-handed, social). The clip list is in the "Recommendation" section of `characters/README.md`.
  (The local side already added the missing gloot and quest_weaver LICENSE files and removed `proton_scatter/demos` because of its non-redistributable textures.)
- Place the new houses, stalls, props, animals and monsters when convenient. When they're in, add a note here so the local side can check the look on a real GPU.
